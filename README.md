10. Updating Budgets
   To update the budget, the user must enter a valid category from the budget table. The remainder amounts and percentages will be calculated based on the net income of the incomes and expenses that share the same category.
   For example:
   Income M = 1000   &   Expense M = 850
   Net Income M = Income M - Expense M = 150

   Therefore, 
   Budget M Amount - Net Income M = 1500 - 150 = 1350
